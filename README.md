# Welcome to the Nexient Technical Interview!

#### Notes

- This repo was created using Create-React-App with the Typescript variant.
- If you're unfamiliar with TypeScript that's totally okay!

  - JavaScript has been enabled so that you can use the familiar `.jsx` and `.js` file extensions as you would an any other React application.

#### Submission

- Go ahead and make commits as usual - note that you _will not_ have pushing permissions

1. when you're ready to submit, you should run `git format-patch origin` which will output a series of git patches.
2. Zip up the files and send them to us at **\_\_\_** (need to setup an email)

- (For the Interviewer) to apply the patches, check out a temp branch, move the patches from the submission to the root directory, and run `git apply *.patch`
